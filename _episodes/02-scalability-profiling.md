## Benchmarking your Code

FIXME: using suitable platform (possibly a DiRAC standardised benchmark machine?) to do it, how to do it, 

## Comparison with Amdahl's Law Predictions

FIXME: illustrate how example code benchmark graph compares against predictions from Amdahl's Law. Show good and bad scalability example graphs

## Next Steps

FIXME: basics of code profiling if needed (key question: where specifically does it perform badly and why?), tools to do this
