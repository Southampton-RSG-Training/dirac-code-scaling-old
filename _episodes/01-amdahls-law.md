## Predicting Code Scalability: Amdahl's Law

FIXME: intro to Amdahl's Law, how it can help us understand weak/strong scaling for code - grab overview from http://www.hpc-carpentry.org/hpc-parallel-novice/02-parallel-estimate/index.html

## Using Amdahl's Law

FIXME: apply Amdahl's Law to predict code speedup using multiple processors for a given codebase.
